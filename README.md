# Personal Portfolio

This template is for [https://trevkillick.dev](trevkillick.dev), based on React with Vite and Typescript, react is complete overkill for a personal website but this framework is being used to teach myself something different from AngularJS. 

## Features

- Responsive design with a customizable theme (dark/light mode).
- Built with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for streamlined styling.
- Anonymous analytics powered by [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com).
- Clean and minimalistic layout.

## Logo

The website currently uses the TailwindCSS logo as a placeholder for demonstration purposes. **The TailwindCSS logo is not owned by me and is not licensed for use in this repository.** It is included solely as an example, and you should replace it with your own logo or a licensed alternative if you use this project.

For more information about the TailwindCSS logo and its usage guidelines, visit the [official TailwindCSS branding page](https://tailwindcss.com/brand).


## Setup

This is not designed as a guide but the following steps were used to get the basics working:

* New React app with Typescript created using ```npm create vite@latest```
* Install [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite](tailwindCSS)
* Run ```npm run dev```

Some additional dependencies have been added along the way like image optimizer, react router and FontAwesome.
